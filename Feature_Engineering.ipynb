        "Description: Assigns each category a unique integer label.\n",

        "\n",
        "Consideration: Not ideal for nominal variables without inherent order, as it may introduce unintended ordinal relationships.\n",

        "\"\"\"An optimizer in machine learning is an algorithm used to adjust the parameters (such as weights and biases) of a model to minimize the loss function, thereby improving the model's performance. Optimizers determine how the model learns from the data by updating parameters in a way that reduces errors over time.\n",

        "Types of Optimizers and Their Examples\n",
        "1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n",
        "Description: SGD updates the model parameters using the gradient of the loss function with respect to a single data point (or a small batch).\n",
